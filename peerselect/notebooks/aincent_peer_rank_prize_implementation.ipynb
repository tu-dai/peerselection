    "Better Crowd Sourcing\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are combining bits of Omer's method of impartial peer review with elements of Toby's Markovian/Stable State algorithms.  The basic algorithm implemented below is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. We want to select $k$ elements from a set of $n$ agents by partitioning into $m$ agents.\n",
    "1. Each of the $n$ agents submits a score between $0.0 - 1.0$ for all the other agents.\n",
    "2. Agents are randomly partitioned into $m$ partitions of size $\\frac{n}{m}$.\n",
    "3. The scores of these partitions are determined by a process (Dividing a Dollar or Markovian) which determines a share for each partition $x_i$.\n",
    "5. We use an aportionment method to turn the share $x_i$ into integers and select the top elements from that partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased Peer Rank Method\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have implemented hte biased PeerRank method from Toby.  The origional formulation doesn't take into account missing information or what happens when we don't want agents to grade themselves.  We discuss this generalization here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the formulation below $A_{i,j}$ is the grade that agent $j$ gives to agent $i$ This gives us the nice formalism that row i is the grades that agent i has recieved.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an $n\\times n$ matrix where agent $i$ gives a grade to agent $j$ in $A_{j,i}$.  We suppose all marks are in the interval $[0.0, 1.0]$.  We are also given a self-loop constant $\\alpha$ in $ 0.0 < \\alpha < 1.0$. We are also given a $\\beta$ which is the prize for doing well.\n",
    "Let r_i be the set of agents that $i$ has submitted a grade for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must have that $\\alpha + \\beta \\leq 1$. We can now define the start and update steps as:\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note: fix from here the equations for people raing less than.. only need to modify the second term of the matrix but doesn't matter if beta is 0. **\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G^0_i = \\frac{1}{|r_i|} \\sum_{j=1}^m A_{i,j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and update as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G^{n+1}_i = (1 - \\alpha - \\beta) \\cdot G^n_i + \\frac{\\alpha}{|G^{n}|_{\\ell=1}} \\cdot G^{n} \\cdot A_{i,:}^T + \\frac{\\beta}{m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m} 1 - |A_{j,i} - G^n_j| $$\n",
    "\n",

    "Dividing A Dollar\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Omer has proposed a divide the dollar scheme where we compute shares for a particular partition $m_i$ as follows.  Let $n - m_i$ be the set of agents outside the partition $m_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_k = \\frac{\\sum_{\\forall i \\in n - m_i, \\forall j \\in m_i} A_{ji}}{n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme is implemented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that we normalize the agents' scores with respect to the outside clusters. So we need to blank them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apportionment\n",
    "======================\n",
    "0. Let $s_i$ be the share of $i$ defined as $x_i * k$.\n",
    "1. Check if $\\sum_{i} \\lfloor s_i \\rfloor = k$ then quit, else. (this implies that all $x_i*k$ are integer and that there could have been no manipulation).\n",
    "2. Foreach $i$: if $\\lceil s_i \\rceil - s_i > \\frac{1}{n}$ then $s_i = \\lfloor s_i \\rfloor$ else $s_i = \\lceil s_i \\rceil$\n",
    "3. if $\\sum_{i} s_i < k $ then increment $k - \\sum_{i} s_i$ clusters according to the distribution indiuced by the dollar shares and increase shares of the selected clusters by 1 (with replacement).\n",
    "4. elif $\\sum_{i} s_i > k$ then select $\\sum_{i} s_i - k$ according to the inverse dollar share distribution given by $\\forall i: \\frac{1 - s_i}{\\sum_{j}s_j}$ and decrease shares of the selected clusters by 1 (with replacement).\n",
